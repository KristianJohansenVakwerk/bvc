# Code Guidelines for BVC.next

## General Principles

- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

## TypeScript

- Always use TypeScript for new files
- Avoid `any` type - use proper types or `unknown` when necessary
- Use type inference where possible, but be explicit for function parameters and return types
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/intersections
- Use `Readonly<>` for props when appropriate

## React/Next.js

- Use functional components with a `const Name () => {}` and `export default Name`
- Use Server Components by default (Next.js App Router)
- Only use Client Components (`'use client'`) when necessary (interactivity, browser APIs)
  – Always add a className props to components

- Prefer async Server Components for data fetching
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Use Next.js Link component for internal navigation
- Keep components in separate files when they're reusable or complex
  – When creating a new component always define a (`type`) called Props and pass it on to the component
  – Extract the defined (`Props`) from (`props`) in groups `const {propName} = props`

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Prefer Tailwind classes over custom CSS when possible
- Use CSS variables for theme values (colors, spacing, etc.)
- Follow mobile-first responsive design approach
- Use semantic HTML elements

## File Organization

- Place components in appropriate directories (components/, app/, etc.)
- Use kamelCase for file names (e.g., `userProfile.tsx`)
  – When adding a component add it to a folder with the same name
- Co-locate related files (components, styles, tests) when they're tightly coupled
- Keep the `app/` directory structure clean and organized
- For components add subfolders for different types of components `globals`, `shared` and `UI Put the components in the approbiate folder

## Code Style

- Use double quotes for strings (consistent with project)
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer const over let, avoid var

## Imports

- Group imports: external packages, then internal modules
- Use absolute imports with `@/` alias when configured
- Remove unused imports

## Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully with proper error boundaries
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages

## Performance

- Use React.memo() for expensive components that re-render frequently
- Use useMemo() and useCallback() judiciously (not prematurely)
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Lazy load components when appropriate

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels when needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios
